This level presents us an even more secure version of level 15
In this level it is exactly the same except they have removed any visual feedback from a query
Fortunately, there are other ways for us to determine true and false
In particular, we can use execution time by making use of the SQL sleep() function
Since an average query will execute in under a second we can use sleep(1) to force the sql to take longer to complete if it is true
We can then use our same code from level 15 to narrow down our pool of characters and build our password string
Running this will give us our password
