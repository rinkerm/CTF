In this level we get a login text box
Viewing the source code of the level we can see that it is checking if the password contains "iloveyou" and is valued at greater than 10
Looking at the way php evaluates comparing strings to integers we can see that if a string contains . e or E it is evaluated as a float
It also takes any numerical data at the front of the string and uses that for the comparison
Thus, we can enter any number greater than 10 followed by any string that contains " iloveyou "
Entering this will reveal the flag
