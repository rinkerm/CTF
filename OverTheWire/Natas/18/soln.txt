This level at first appears to be another sql manipulation to login
However when we inspect the source code we can see it is not executing a sql query but is instead looking for a specific session id
We can see that it assigns a random id between 1 and 640 and assigns it to you when you log in
It saves this to a cookie with name "PHPSESSID"
We can also see that on subsequent page visits it checks who you are logged in as by checking this cookie
So it looks like all we need to do is find out which cookie is associated with the admin login
We can easily brute force this by using a script to log in incrementally changing our cookie value
We can check if the session is an admin by checking if the page contains "regular user" (We can see that this displays by attempting to log in manually)
I did this by making a python script exploit.py that works very similarly to our level 15 script
Running this gives our password
