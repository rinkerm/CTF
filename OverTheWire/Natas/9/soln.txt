In this challenge we have a search input bar
We can also click on view source code to see the code for this search function
Upon inspection we see that it takes our input and inserts it into a unix command which is then executed
This is easily exploitable as we can put some text followed by a semicolon and then add our own command
Using test; ls; we can see what is in our current directory
We can continually step backwards with .. to find where the /etc directory is as we already know that is where the passwords are stored
Then, we can use the following command:
test; cat ../../../../etc/natas_webpass/natas10;
This will return our password
