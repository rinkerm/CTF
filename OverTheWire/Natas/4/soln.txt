For this challenge we see that we have an access denied error because we are not accessing the page from the correct address
Because of this we know we must spoof our referrer to the page so that the site thinks we are in fact coming from natas5
To do this you can use burpsuite
With burpsuite running you can capture the request and modify the referrer from natas4 to natas5
Then, we can click "forward" to submit the request
The resulting webpage will display our next password
