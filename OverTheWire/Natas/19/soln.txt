As we can see when we log in to this level it is almost identical to the last one
The creator of the level even writes it at the top in lieu of providing us source code
So, the first thing I did was I attempted to log in and looked at the cookie value
The first thing that jumped out to me was that this was a hex string
So, I dropped it into a hex-ascii converter and saw 131-admin (I attemped to log in as admin)
This told me that it is taking the session id and the username and encoding it into hex and saving it to the cookie
So, I copied the exploit script from the last challenge and edited it to contain the correct hex encoded value
After running it I got the password
