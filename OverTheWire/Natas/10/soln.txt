This is a variation on the last problem
We have the same search bar but in the source code we can see that they are now sanitizing inputs
If we look at the code we can see that we cannot use any of the following symbols ";&|"
However, we know that with grep we can match a string against multiple files
So:
a /etc/natas_webpass/natas11 will execute grep -i a /etc/natas_webpass/natas11 dictionary.txt
This doesn't return anything special, but we know that there must be an a in the password for this to work
So we can try every character in the alphabet 
c /etc/natas_webpass/natas11 will yield our flag
