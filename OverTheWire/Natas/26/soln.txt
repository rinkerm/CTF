In this challenge we are given a tool that uses cookies to draw a picture given our inputs
When we look at the source code we can see that it reads the cookie into memory and unencrypts it
In terms of encyption the cookie is a serialized array that is then encoded in base64
I wrote a decrypt function in the exploit.php script that demonstrates how this works
We also can see there is a logger object that upon its destructor being called writes its "exitMsg" variable to a file specified in its "logFile" variable
Since our decrypted cookie is loaded into memory we can inject a logger object into the program through this and when the program fails it will call the logger destructor
This works because objects that are serialized like this only take their internal variables with them.
They do not carry function definitions.
So, we can set the exitMsg to write some php code and use the logFile to create a .php file on the server
Next, we encrypt this logger object to get our cookie
Then, if we have an existing "drawing" cookie we delete it
Then type javascript:void(document.cookie="drawing=encryptedstring") into our address bar
Refreshing will have the server load our cookie
We can then navigate to the log file we created to see our password
