This level presents us another injection problem
Here we have an input box that gives us control over the username of our session
Looking at the source code we can see that there are debug messages that can help us see what is going on
As we have learned from past levels we can fill out the form automatically by appending ?name=[OurValue] to the url
We can also combine this with ?debug to show the debug messages
Since we need to find a way to set the admin variable to 1 we can look at the debug messages from setting our name to admin
index.php?debug&name=admin
From this we can see the server reads until it stops reading in any data, so if we were to add a newline character to the name we could add a second line for the server to read
So: index.php?debug&name=admin%0Aadmin+1 should do what we want (%0A is a newline in hex)
Going to this address will write our user file to the server
Refreshing again will display the flag
