This level presents us with a page where we can select the language of text to display
We see that we can manipulate this with the ?lang variable to select what file to load
However, there are some input validation statements in the source code
Namely, it replaces all instances of ../ to '' and does not allow us to access the natas_webpass directory
However, we can see that it writes to a log file which we can access using our cookie value (file is natas25_COOKIEVALUE.log)
So,
?lang=../.../...//logs/natas25_b5nqp6f7a5uobg80giuv0vsoc7.log
We can also see that the server writes the user agent of the request to the file.
So, using burpsuite we can inject some php by changing the user-agent field in the request header
Here I used the user-agent to print out the password in the __MSG field (Note: you can use __GREETING, __MSG, or __FOOTER)
<?php global $__MSG; $__MSG=file_get_contents('/etc/natas_webpass/natas26'); ?>
Adding this to the request in BurpSuite gives our password
