In this level we are given a blank page with a view source code option
Naturally, we need to look at the source
We can see there is a php variable called revelio that the code is looking for
There are two php code blocks
The first checks if the revelio variable appears and if it does it checks if the session is an admin
If the session is an admin it allows the page to appear, otherwise it removes the variable
The second code block displays the next levels login info if the variable appears
We can actually just capture the page data in burpsuite and capture the level password without setting the cookie to an admin session
Thus if we add /?revelio to our url and then look at the page data in burpsuite we reveal the password
