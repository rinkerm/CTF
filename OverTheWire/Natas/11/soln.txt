This challenge gives us an input box to enter a background color
It also mentions that the cookies are protecting by XOR encryption
Well, what is XOR encryption? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher
From here we can see that it encodes data using the XOR operation against a constant repeating key
We can also see that due to the fact that plaintext XOR cyphertext = key it is weak to a known-plaintext attack (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known-plaintext_attack)
This information will help us when looking at the source code which is also offered to us.
From this we can see that there is a json array created with value {"showpassword"="no","bgcolor"=#ffffff}
This is then run through the base64_decode function, xor encrypted, and then json_decoded.
This value is then saved into our "data" cookie.
We now know both the cyphertext and the plaintext and can conduct a known-plaintext attack
By running exploit.php (original cookie value is hardcoded) we can generate the value we need to put into our cookie to get the password
Adding this value in and refreshing will display the password
