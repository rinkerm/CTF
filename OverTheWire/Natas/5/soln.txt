This level displays a page saying that we are not logged in 
If we investigate the page data we can see there is a cookie named loggedin with value 0
We can edit this in two ways
1. We can edit it in the development tools in our browser
2. We can type javascript:void(document.cookie="loggedin=1"); into our browser address bar
Either way we can now refresh and claim the password
