This level requires you to capture request and change their contents
On this level we have two colocated webpages, natas21 and natas21-experimenter
The first page is just a page that shows whether or not we are logged in as an admin
The second page allows us to update the page's css
So, we can capture the request from this site to change our admin variable
To do this I used burpsuite
With burpsuite running you can submit a post request by clicking the update button on the page
I then appended &admin=1 to the post request in burpsuite
Next, we copy the value of the PHPSESSID cookie from the experimenter page and paste it to the cookie on the natas21 page
Refreshing the page displays that we are now logged in as an admin and can claim our password
