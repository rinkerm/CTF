This level appears to be the same as the last one except for the source code
The source code of the page is extremely short so we know that the only vulnerability must lie in the strcmp function
If you read the php documentation you will see that if the two variables are not both strings then you will get strange return values
We abused something similar to this for the last level
So, by playing around with the data type of our input we should be able to break the code and get our flag
Additionally, we see that we want the strcmp function to return 0 as !0 = 1 and would make the if statement evaluate to true
However, !null = 1 as well so if we can get the strcmp function to return null then we will succeed as well
In the strcmp man page someone has added a note detailing the different types of inputs you could give to this function and what their output would be
We can see the combination of string and array yields null
When we submit our password we see that /?passwd="input" is appended to our search bar
If we  change this to /?passwd[]="whateverwewant" we can break the comparison and get our flag
