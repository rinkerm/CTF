This challenge is almost identical to the previous one
However, our input is now sanitized to only accept jpg files... sort of...
We can attack this page very similarly to our last one
We make a modified version of our payload from the last challenge with two changes
1. We change natas13 to natas14
2. We add 4 random characters to the beginning of the file (I used zeros)
The purpose of those 4 random characters is to give us some useless bytes we can edit in hexedit to make our file appear to be a jpg
We then save our php file as payload.jpg and open it in hexedit
We then replace those 4 random characters with the jpg image and application markers "FF D8 FF E0"
This will fool any checks making it think our file is a jpg
We can test this by doing "file payload.jpg" in our command line
This will output "JPEG image data" telling us that our machine believes that the file is a jpg
We now go back to the site and upload payload.jpg and change the form to submit a php file
Going to the given address will give us our next password
