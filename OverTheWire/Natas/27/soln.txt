In this level we are given a sql login box
If we enter anything into the box we can see that if the login does not appear in the database it makes a login
If we enter the login info for something in the database it displays the information for that login
We can see in the source code that all of our input is sanitized so it appears SQL injection is not possible
However, we can instead take note of the size of each item in the database: 64 characters
Also we should note that due to peculiarities of SQL "admin " and "admin" are virtually identical.
So we can create a duplicate version of the natas28 login by entering natas28 then 58 spaces and then some other character.
This will first make our entered string appear different than the existing natas28 login.
It will then have to be truncated to fit into the database where it will then be functionally identical to the existing natas28 login
We can then login with whatever password we put for our new login (I used a blank password)
This prints our password
