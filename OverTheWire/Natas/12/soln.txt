This challenge allows us to upload a jpg file to the server
Interestingly, the input sanitization is a little bit off
We can actually upload a php file that will be run by the server if we go into inspect element and just change the file extension on the form
So, we make payload.php to print out the password file stored at /etc/natas_webpass/natas13
Changing the form to upload a php file and uploading our payload gives us a message with the address of our file
Navigating to this page gives us our password
