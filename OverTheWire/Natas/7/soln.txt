In this page we are presented with two links "home" and "about"
Inspecting the code of the home page gives us a hint that the password is stored in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8
When we click on the "About" page we see "index.php?page=about" in our address bar
If we change this to "index.php?page=/etc/natas_webpass/natas8" we can access the file with our flag
