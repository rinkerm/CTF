This level is a more difficult version of levels 9 and 10
In this level we see more characters are not allowed
This level forces us to brute force the password in a similar method to the previous challenge
We can use $() to pass the result of a command into the grep -i dictionary.txt command
If we combine this with something that we know has a return value we can construct a blind attack
This takes advantage of the fact that when grep does not find any matches it returns ''
Thus if we take a word that is in the dictionary (I used false) we will see that false[Password] returns nothing whereas false returns text
Therefore if the return value is blank we know that our query is true and if it contains data we are incorrect
We can use this to first narrow down our field of characters to test
Then, using grep's extended regex capabilities we can build our password one character at a time until we have found all 32 characters
I modified exploit.py from Natas 15 to accomplish this for us
Running it will give us our password
