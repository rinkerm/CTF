This level introduces us to tracing code with gdb
We are given a binary that takes in a 4digit code
Naturally, we could brute force this but the intended solution is for those who have no programming skills
So, how can we figure this out
First we run a ltrace and see that our input is being put into an atoi function call
Next we load up gdb
If we disassemble the main function we can see that our input is being compared to something at ebp+0xc
Since this comparison takes place at line main+84 we can simply set a breakpoint there and check the value of that register
So: b *main+84
r 0000 to run the program and pass in 0000
When we hit our breakpoint we can simply do x/u $esp+0xc
This gives us 7123
Next we run the binary with argument 7123
We got a new shell
Typing whoami tells us that we are now leviathan7
We can then print out the password file
