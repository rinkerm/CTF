This level is actually quite complicated
We need to abuse a quirk in the way the file given to us processes inputs
If we look at this file with an ltrace we can see it calls access and cat on our input
access is how it checks if we have permission to access the file we are trying to access
It determines this by checking the owner of the full filepath
However, cat does not take the full filepath it prints up until the first space
So, if we create a file with a space in the name we can get this to check if we own our own file and then print the password file
So we go to our tmp directory and create a file "test test"
We then make a symbolic link to our password file ln -s /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3 test
Now we can do ~/printfile "test test"
This will output our password
