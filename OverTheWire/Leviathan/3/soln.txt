In my opinion this level is far easier than the last level
Here we have a binary that we can run
If we run it it asks us for password (seem familiar)
If we run ltrace on it we see that it checks if our entered value is equal to snlprintf
Entering that gives us a shell as leviathan4
Cat the password file to get the next password
