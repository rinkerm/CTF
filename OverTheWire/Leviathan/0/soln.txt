In this level the home directory appears empty
Weird considering all information is supposed to be there
ls -all shows a hidden .backup folder
In this folder is a file bookmarks.html
This contains a lot of html but our password could be hidden in it somewhere
cat bookmarks.html | grep "leviathan1" 
Gives our password
