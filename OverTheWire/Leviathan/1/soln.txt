In this level we are given an executable named check
Running this file it asks us for a password
Clearly we need to find out what this password is
Running gdb and disassembling the main function we can see that it takes in 3 characters
Next it compares those 3 characters against some string
If it is correct is sets the userid of the user to some other value
We can assume that this means if we have the password it will allow us access to all of leviathan2's files
Thus, we can get the password from /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2
So how do we know what characters to use?
This problem set explicitly states no coding knowledge is required so while we could brute force this there is no point as there must be an easier way
Running a ltrace against the executable shows us the strcmp call
We now can see the password is "sex" (How creative)
We can now run the program and enter our password and then cat the password file to get our next level password
