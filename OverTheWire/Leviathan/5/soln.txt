This level is an easier version of an earlier challenge
Here we are presented with a binary
Running it tells us it cant find a file called /tmp/file.log
Okay, so what if we make a /tmp/file.log
It doesn't seem to do anything besides deleting it
What if we put something into this file?
Add "test" to the file through vim
Leviathan5 prints out what is in the file
So, we can create a symbolic link to the password file to get it
ln -s /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan6 /tmp/file.log
Run the binary leviathan5 to get the password
