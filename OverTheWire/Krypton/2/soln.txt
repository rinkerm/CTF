In this challenge we know from the readme that we are looking at a caesar cipher
We can use the binary given in our temp directory to see how it encrypts a plaintext.
We can make a keyfile containing "A" and see what letter it is changed to so we can see the offset
As with the caesar cipher all letters are converted by the same offset we can decipher and given cipher text from just one letter
We see from this test that A->M
Thus we can take the krypton3 file and run the following command
cat krypton3 | tr '[M-ZA-Lm-za-l]' '[A-Za-z]'
This yield our password:
CAESARISEASY
