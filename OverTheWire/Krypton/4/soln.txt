This challenge gives us a vignere cipher with 2 found texts encrypted using the same key as our ciphertext
Additionally, we are given the length of the key
Since the vignere cipher is well known there are many automated analysis tools that we can use to find the key easily
We can take one of our foundtexts and use it with the given key length to produce our key
Through this we find that it is frekey
Next, we can decipher our ciphertext using this key to get our password:
CLEARTEXT
