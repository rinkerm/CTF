In this challenge we are given an alphabet substitution cipher
This challenge is relatively easy but it does require a bit of legwork in terms of frequency analysis
We are given 4 other ciphertexts encrypted using the same key. We can use these to conduct some frequency analysis on characters
We can then use this information to find the key by manually or automatically solving the cipher text
This can be done using some online tools to make filling it out faster and can pretty easily be cracked automatically once a few words/letters have been filled in
ex. start by solving for "the" as this can start to open up the cipher
Eventually, we can find the key is: 'BOIHGKNQVTWYURXZAJEMSLDFPC'
We can then use tr to find the plaintext of the password file
cat kyptos4 | tr 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' 'BOIHGKNQVTWYURXZAJEMSLDFPC'
This gives us the message
WELL DONE THE LEVEL FOUR PASSWORD IS BRUTE
