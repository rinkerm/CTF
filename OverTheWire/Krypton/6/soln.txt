In this challenge we are given a stream cipher
We have a binary encrypt6 which will encrypt our plaintext using the keyfile.dat in the directory
We can essentially create a copy of this key by giving a plaintext file of all "0" in this case our "0" is "A"
We create a file of 100 As as this should be a sufficient size to see a pattern
From this we can find that the key is a set of 30 repeating characters "EICTDGYIYZKTHNSIRFXYCPFUEOCKRN"
We can use this with a simple python program to decrypt our ciphertext
crack.py is included in this repository
From this, we get our plaintext LFSRISNOTRANDOM
