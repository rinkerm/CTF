In this challenge we have another vignere cipher with the same kind of situation except now we do not know the keylength
Using online tools as before we can instead analyze the cipher text to see if we can find a pattern in them
From this we can see that two of our cipher texts likely have a keylength of 18 while the last has a keylength of 9
This is likely caused by the irregular breaks in text to disguise the word lengths. 
Since we know that the key is the same for all texts we can safely assume the key is 9.
This is easier for us to determine as 9|18. 
Thus, we can fix the length of our key at 9 and see what happens for all our texts.
We get some weird and different results for each of our texts. However, for found1  we can see the key is xeylencth
This looks a lot like "keylength" so we can try this as the program is likely confused due to the irregular breaks
This works and will give us our password when we use the krypton6 text on it
RANDOM
