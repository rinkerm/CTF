In this level we have a hexdump of a file that was repeatedly compressed
We first need to copy this file to the tmp directory so we can save copies of it and create new files
mkdir /tmp/mydir
cp data.txt /tmp/mydir
We then navigate to that directory
Now we can restore the hexdump to its original format 
xxd -r data
We can now start to uncompress the file
Using the file command we can see that data is a gzip compressed file
So we rename it to a .gz (mv data data.gz)
Now we uncompress it
gunzip data.gz
We can now use file on this once again to see that it is a bzip2 compressed file
bzip2 -d data
Now using file again we see that it is another gzip compressed file
So we rename it to a gz (mv data.out data.gz)
Then uncompress it
gunzip data.gz
Using file again we can now see it is a tar archive
tar --extract -f data
Using file on the resulting file (data5.bin) we see it is another tar archive
tar --extract -f data5.bin
Using file again we can see it is once again a bzip2
bzip2 -d data6.bin
The resulting file is now a tar archive
tar --extract -f data6.bin.out
This gives a gz file, so we rename it (mv data8.bin data8.gz)
gunzip data8.gz
Finally we have an ascii text file. 
Using cat on this file gives our flag
