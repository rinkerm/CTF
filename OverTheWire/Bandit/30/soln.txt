This is another git challenge
We clone the repository to our temp directory
git clone ssh://bandit30-git@localhost/home/bandit30-git/repo
Next we take a loot at the readme file
Since there is no info in here we can check the branches, logs, and tags
Given that we have already passed two challenges involving branches and logs we can assume that this challenge concerns tags
git tag
This prings out all the tags in this repository
We can see that there is a tag called secret
We can then show the value of this tag
git show secret
This gives our flag
