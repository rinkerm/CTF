This level has us once again finding a file except we now have the stipulation that we have to search over the entire server
The file also has the following properties: 33 bytes, owned by user bandit7, owned by group bandit 6
Thus we can use the following command to find the file
find -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6
From this we see the flag is located in /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
Using cat on this file yields our flag
