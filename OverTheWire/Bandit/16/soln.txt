For this level we must identify the port to send the current password to
To do this we use nmap
nmap localhost -p31000-32000 -A
This tells us the services running on all open ports
We know that there is one port open that is running an unknown service
Since the other ports are running the echo service we know the port we are looking for is port 31790
echo cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd | openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -ign_eof
This gives us a RSA private key for use with ssh
