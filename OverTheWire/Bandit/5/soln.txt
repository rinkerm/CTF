In this level we have a text file hidden among several other text files in the inhere directory
We can find the name of the file we are looking for by looking at the given properties:
human-readable, 1033 bytes in size, not executable
We can use the find command to narrow down our list of files
find -depth -size 1033c -readable
This gives us one file ./maybehere07/.file2
Using cat on this file gives us our flag
