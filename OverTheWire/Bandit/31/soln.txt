This is the final git repository challenge
First we clone to our temp directory
git clone ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo
Next we look at the readme file. 
It appears that we need to push a text file to remote
So:
echo "May I come in?" >> key.txt
git add key.txt
git commit -m "Add an item"
This tells us that we have nothing to commit even though we have added a file
We can check with git status
This shows us that the key.txt file is untracked
ls -all shows us that there is a .gitignore which is the culprit
rm .gitignore
git add .
git commit -m "Add an item"
git push
This will yield our flag
