This is another git repository challenge
We go to our tmp directory and clone the repository
ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo
Now we navigate to the directory and once again print out the readme file
We can now see that the password has been redacted.
The file also contains a hint about notes
So, we take a look at the commit notes
git log
We can now see that the current commit is after the password has been redacted we can use git checkout to go back to an earlier branch
git checkout c086d11a00c0648d095d04c089786efef5e01264
Now if we print out the readme file we can see the password
