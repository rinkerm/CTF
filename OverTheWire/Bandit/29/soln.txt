In this level we once again have to clone a github repository to our temp directory
git clone ssh://bandit29-git@localhost/home/bandit29-git/repo
When we print the readme we see that no passwords are put into files in the production code
This indicates that passwords may be located in a development branch
We can list all the branches of the repository:
git branch --all
We can then switch to the development branch:
git checkout dev
Inside the development branch, printing the readme file will give our flag
