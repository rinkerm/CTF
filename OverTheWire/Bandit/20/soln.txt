On this level we are tasked with running a program against a localhost port
If the port gives the password for the current level it will receive the password for the next level
To do this we must first setup the port to send the password
First we open a new terminal by using screen
screen
echo "GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j" | nc -l localhost -p 1337
Then swapping away from screen back to our main terminal we run the program
./suconnect 1337
We can now swap back to our screen instance
screen -r *screeninstance name*
This will yield our next password
