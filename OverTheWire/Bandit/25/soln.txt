In this level we are given a sshkey to log in to bandit26
Normally this would be easy but bandit26 has a modified shell that kicks us out after printing all the text
We can bypass this by using the "more" element of the shell
If our terminal window is small enough that it cannot print the entire message we see "more" appear at the bottom
We can then use the command interface to open vim by pressing v
From there we can use the command
:set shell=/bin/bash
followed by 
:shell
To escape back to a normal shell
From there we can easily get the password for level 26
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26
