This is the final level (as of writing)
This is an escape challenge
We need to escape the uppercase shell to be able to get the password
Fortunately, since this is an interactive shell it is quite easy
By entering $0 we can reset the shell and enter the normal shell
From there we can do:
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33 to get the final flag
