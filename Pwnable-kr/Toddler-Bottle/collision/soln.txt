In this challenge we need to create a hash collision to produce the flag
We can see that the file col.c takes in a string of characters as input
It then turns the character array into an array of integers
It then adds the 5 resulting integers and checks it against a value 0x21DD09EC
So, to solve this we need to come up with 5 integers that when added together will create 0x21DD09EC
We then need to change them to characters and add pass them as input to the file
We can find these characters by taking the given string and dividing it by 5
This gives 0x6C5CEC8 with a remainder of 4
So, our final string will be four repititions of 0x6C5CEC8 and one occurence of 0x6C5CECC
Finally, we will need to reverse the bytes when submitting to the file because it is little endian
./col `echo -e '\xC8\xCE\xC5\x6\xC8\xCE\xC5\x6\xC8\xCE\xC5\x6\xC8\xCE\xC5\x6\xCC\xCE\xC5\x6'`
Running this command yields our flag
daddy! I just managed to create a hash collision :)
