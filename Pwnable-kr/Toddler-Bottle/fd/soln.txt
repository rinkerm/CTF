In this challenge we need to use our knowledge of linux file IO to get the flag
When we ssh into the server we see three files fd, fd.c, flag.txt
Naturally, we cannot access flag.txt
We can look at fd.c
We can see that it accepts one argument that is an integer
It then uses that to calculate where in the buffer to read
If what it reads is equal to LETMEWIN\n it gives us the flag
By looking at the calculation we see the integer we pass in is subtracted by 0x1234
We can thus have it read from the start of the buffer.
In decimal 0x1234 = 4660
Thus:
echo "LETMEWIN" | ./fd 4660
This gives our flag
mommy! I think I know what a file descriptor is!!
