Basic 11

Password : somewhere close

This level is quite different from the rest of the basic challenges.
As we refresh the page we see that all the songs displayed are by Elton John.
If we go to https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/11/e/ we see that we are in the directory view
We can then navigate to the end of the directory https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/11/e/l/t/o/n/
However it appears to be empty. 
Except we can then try to access the .htaccess file.
This indicates that there is a hidden directory "DaAnswer"
If we navigate to that we see: The answer is somewhere close! Just look a little harder.
This is a little wordplay to tell us that the password is "somewhere close".
We can then navigate to https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/11/index.php and input the answer to complete the level
