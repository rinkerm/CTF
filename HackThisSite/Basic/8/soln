Basic 8

Password : 21a92c3f

This level has a php script that records your name and makes a temporary file containing a greeting to you.
We can abuse this using injection.
Inputing the command: <!--#exec cmd="ls .."--> in the place of our name.
This gives us the output of ls .. in the resulting file for our name.
We then use this to access the password file on the server and get the password.
