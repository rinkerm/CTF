Basic 7

Password : efca5264

This level has a hidden unencrypted password file saved in the same directory as the page.
We have to find the name of that password file to open it and see the password.
Thankfully, there is a script that returns an output fron a UNIX command.
We can inject our own command into the script by typing ;ls -l. 
After typing this in we can click on the view button and see the results of our script.
This shows us that there is a file k1kh31b1n55h.php.
We can then open this file like before and see the password displayed for us in plain text.
