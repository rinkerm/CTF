Basic 10

Password : 

This level can be passed in two ways.
The first way is to modify the cookie placed in our browser after unsucessfully submitting a password.
We find the cookie and change it either through our browser settings or in the browser.
In the browser we can put javascript:void(document.cookie="level10_authorized=yes"); into the address bar.
This will change the value of the cookie.
Then we can simply click the submit button again and pass the level.
Alternatively, we can capture the request and change the authorized value to pass the level.
