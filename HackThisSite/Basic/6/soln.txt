Basic 6

Password : a35c1284

This level uses a basic encryption algorithm. 
We can see how this works by encrypting our own string. 
I used abcdefg but you can use any string you wish.
abcdefg gives acegikm.
From this we can notice that every letter has been shifted by a different number.
a>a (0) b>c(1) c>e(2) d>g(3) e>i(4) f>k(5) g>m(6)
Thus we can take a look at an ascii table and calculate the password from the given encrypted string.
