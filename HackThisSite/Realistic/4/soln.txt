This challenge tasks us with extracting the mailing list of a online store and sending it to "SaveTheWhales"
We start by investigating the submit email form
We see that if we input "test" it gives us an error message giving us the name of the table we are looking for "email"
Furthering our investigation we can look at the other pages of the site
When looking at the products page we can see a query that we can append to
After some trial and error we can get the emails by adding this to our url:
products.php?category=1%20UNION%20ALL%20SELECT%20null,%20*,%20null,%20null%20FROM%20email;
Next, we return to hackthissite and send the emails in a private message to SaveTheWhales to complete the challenge
