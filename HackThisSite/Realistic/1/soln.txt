This challenge gives us a simple band ranking site where our task is to hack the site so our friend's band "Raging Inferno" is ranked first.
When we first open the site we get a hint about what the exploit might be given that the first team has a score of over 20 when the scale is between 1 and 5
When inspecting the code we can see that the forms allow us to manipulate the value submitted
Thus, we just need to change the value to something obscenely large and submit the form
This completes the challenge and returns us to the hackthissite challenge page.
