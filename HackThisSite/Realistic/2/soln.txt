In this challenge we are tasked with getting to the admin panel of a site
On the homepage of the site we can find a hidden login button on the bottom of the page.
We can edit the code of the page so that it appears in a different text color so it is visible
This takes us to the login page
We can manipulate the sql of the login to allow us to bypass the password
This is done by inputting ' or ''=' as both the username and password
Doing this and clicking login will complete the challenge and return us to the challenges page
