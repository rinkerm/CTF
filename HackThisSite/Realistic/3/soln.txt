In this challenge we are tasked with finding the exploit a hacker used to deface the site and then restore the old site
If we inspect the code of the homepage we find a helpful note left by the hacker.
It states that the old page was moved to oldindex.html
If we navigate to oldindex.html we can access the old site.
It is now time to hunt for the exploit
Looking at the old page we can find a php form to submit a poem.
Submitting something lets us see that it just saves the context of the textbox to a file
So to restore the content of the website we can return to oldindex.html and copy the source code
We then go back to the submit poem page and paste the code into the content box and enter ../index.html into the title box
Clicking submit solves the challenge and returns us to the challenge page
